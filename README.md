Project done as part of a technical test for an IT company. 

The goal was to create a RESTful API and display selected information using Laravel, in order to deploy it via Laravel Vapor and AWS service.

I chose to use an API for the top 500 posts on Hacker News and display only the first 10 based on their ratings. The output is provided in JSON format, and the API automatically updates with each request.

It has been an interesting project that allowed me to learn Laravel and PHP, as well as discover AWS services. 

I found Laravel Vapor to be very intuitive and accessible, even for less experienced users. 

The main challenge was adapting the documentation (which may not always be up to date with the latest version of Laravel) to my own project and understanding the limitations of the "free-tier" account compared to the tutorials.
